# Python-music-player
This project creates a music player using python. It uses the concept of GUI to create the app.
The project utilizes modules like pygame and tkinter
There is also involvement of databases where i have used mysql.
The project has the following features:
  Allows the user to select songs from a specific file and loads them to the app.
  Provides the ability to move to a previous/next song, decrease/increase volume.
  It also allows the user to create a playlist where the user can save favourite songs.
However the project has some weakness:
  The app does not automaticaly play the next song and requires manual input.
  I was not able to show case the value of the volume.
  
ENJOY!!
